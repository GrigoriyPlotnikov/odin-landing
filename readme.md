Introduction

For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.

Assignment:

You do not need to make this project responsive. That means you don’t have to adjust your design for different screen sizes, zoom levels, or mobile devices. For now, just focus on making it look good on a regular computer screen. You’ll learn how to handle different screen sizes later.

When you finish, don’t forget to push it up to GitHub!
